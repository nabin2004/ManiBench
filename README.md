# ManiBench: A Benchmark for Testing Visual-Logic Drift and Syntactic Hallucinations in Manim Code Generation

## Overview

**ManiBench** is a specialized benchmark dataset for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) performance in generating Manim CE (Community Edition) code—mathematical animations used for educational content creation.

This benchmark addresses two critical failure modes in LLM-generated code:

1. **Syntactic Hallucinations**: Code that appears valid in Python but references non-existent Manim functions, uses deprecated APIs, or breaks under specific library versions.

2. **Visual-Logic Drift**: Code that executes without errors but produces incorrect, incomplete, or misaligned animations that fail to communicate the intended mathematical concept.

3. **Alignment Score (0.0–1.0)**: Weighted fraction of required visual events present and correctly timed
4. **Coverage Score (0.0–1.0)**: Density of pedagogical elements (labels, formulas, numeric evidence)

### Reference Code Analysis

All 12 problems include `reference_code_analysis` derived from 3Blue1Brown's original ManimGL source code:

| ID | Source Lines | Scene Classes | Visual Techniques | GL→CE Conflicts |
|----|-------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|

## Quick Start

### Automated Evaluation (Recommended)

Run the full benchmark evaluation programmatically using the `evaluation/` framework.
See **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)** for the full developer guide.

#### Using Make (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. One-command setup: venv + deps + .env
make setup

# 2. Add your API key
nano .env   # set OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...

# 3. Activate venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 4. Smoke test (1 API call, no rendering)
make quick-test

# 5. Full evaluation (6 models × 12 problems × 3 trials)
make run

# 6. Chain-of-thought strategy
make run STRATEGY=cot

# 7. Specific models and problems
make run MODELS="gpt-4o claude-sonnet-4" PROBLEMS="MB-001 MB-005" TRIALS=1

# 8. Skip Manim rendering (static analysis only — faster)
make run-fast

# 9. Generate paper tables from results
make analyze

# 10. See all available commands
make help
```

#### Using Python Directly

```bash
# 1. Clone/download the repository
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/nabin2004/ManiBench
cd ManiBench

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Set your OpenRouter API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='sk-or-v1-your-key-here'

# 4. Run evaluation (all models × all problems × 3 trials)
python -m evaluation.run

# 5. Quick test (single model, single problem, 1 trial)
python -m evaluation.run --models gpt-4o --problems MB-005 --trials 1

# 6. Use a specific prompt strategy
python -m evaluation.run --strategy cot --models claude-sonnet-4

### Manual Evaluation

For Evaluators:

1. Read **ManiBench_QuickStart.md** (5 min)
2. Pick a problem from **ManiBench_Pilot_Dataset.json** (e.g., MB-005: Determinant)
3. Prompt an LLM using the `full_prompt` field
4. Run the generated code
5. Score using the rubric in **ManiBench_Evaluation_Rubric.md** (10–15 min per trial)

### For LLM Developers

1. Read **ManiBench_Prompt_Engineering_Guide.md** (10 min)
2. Try different prompting strategies on 2–3 problems
3. Identify which strategy yields highest alignment/coverage
4. Iterate and refine

### For Researchers

1. Read **ManiBench_Specification.md** fully (30 min)
2. Review preliminary results (Section 6)
3. Consider experimental variations (e.g., multi-shot prompting, fine-tuning)
4. Contribute additional problems or improved metrics

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

From evaluating GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 12 problems (3 trials each):

**Executability**:
- Simple problems (Level 2): ~100%
- Medium problems (Level 3): ~67%
- Complex problems (Level 4+): ~33%

**Alignment**:
- Simple problems: 0.80–0.90
- Medium problems: 0.60–0.75
- Complex problems: 0.35–0.60

**Common Failure Modes**:
- Missing events (especially temporal updates)
- Wrong event ordering (e.g., loss curve before dot movement)
- Timeout on 3D visualizations (Hairy Ball Theorem)

---

## Extending ManiBench

### Adding Problems (Roadmap to 150–200)

To expand the benchmark:

1. **Identify video sources** from educational channels (3Blue1Brown, Khan Academy, Numberphile)
2. **Extract visual specifications** by carefully watching each video
3. **Write natural language prompts** (target LLMs, not humans)
4. **Annotate required events** with weights and timing constraints
5. **Test with pilot LLMs** (GPT-4o, Claude, open-source)
6. **Refine rubric** based on ambiguities

See **ManiBench_Specification.md** Section 8 for guidance.

### Contributing

If contributing new problems or improvements:
- Follow JSON format in dataset file
- Ensure required events are objective and measurable
- Test prompt with ≥2 LLMs
- Document any new metrics or evaluation challenges
- Open an issue or PR on GitHub

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
- Manual evaluation of Alignment and Coverage (subjective, time-consuming)
- Limited to Manim CE (not all animation libraries)
- 12 problems may not cover all failure modes
- No user studies validating pedagogical effectiveness

### Future Directions
1. **Automatic Alignment Detection**: Use AST analysis or video frame comparison to score events
2. **Educational Validation**: User studies showing whether animations actually teach concepts
3. **Multi-Library Extension**: Benchmarks for TikZ, Asymptote, Processing, or D3.js
4. **Fine-Tuning Studies**: Can LLMs be fine-tuned on Manim CE code for better performance?
5. **Chain-of-Thought Analysis**: Does reasoning (intermediate thoughts) improve code quality?
